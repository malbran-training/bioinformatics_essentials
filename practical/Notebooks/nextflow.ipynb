    "Nextflow is a workflow management system (consisting of a domain specific language and workflow engine) that can be used to write and run data-intensive bioinformatics workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of Nextflow is that it provides an abstraction between the workflowâ€™s functional logic and the underlying execution system (or runtime). Thus, it is possible to write a workflow that runs seamlessly on your computer, a cluster, or the cloud, without being modified. You simply define the target execution platform (local, lsf, aws etc.) in a configuration file.\n",

    "## Nextflow and Containers  \n",
    "\n",
    "Bioinformatics workflows are rarely composed of a single script or software tool. More often, they depend on many software applications and packages. As noted in the previous section, installing and maintaining such dependencies is a challenging task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, Nextflow uses containers to manage software dependencies. Containers are similar to a virtual machine in that they have their own copy of the file system, processing space, memory management, and software installations etc. They can be run on any computer that supports containers in such a way that they are isolated from the host machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nextflow requires software applications used in a workflow to be encapsulated in one or more self-contained, ready-to-run containers. Nextflow supports both Docker and Singularity containers. We will demonstrate how to use Singularity with Nextflow as the usage of Docker is generally not allowed on compute clusters due to security constraints.\n",

    "## The nf-core project\n",
    "\n",
    "The nf-core project is a community effort to collect a curated set of best-practice analysis pipelines built using Nextflow. It provides Nextflow implementations of modules/subworkflows for common bioinformatics analysis tasks (e.g. running bwa) and pipelines for common bioinformatics workflows (e.g. map and snp call a set of bacterial isolates) along with a set of guidelines that these implementations must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can benefit from nf-core by using existing well-established and tested pipelines rather than having to implement your own Nextflow pipeline. The pipelines offered by nf-core are standardized, portable, well documented and user-friendly and guarantee reproducibility of results. You can also become a developer and write your own pipelines in Nextflow using ready-made modules available in nf-core. However this is out of the scope of this tutorial. "
